\section{Introduction}

We will cover how deep symbolic reinforcement learning extracts symbolic representations from raw input data, which will motivate a discussion of loss functions and the introduction of autoencoders. Seeing the limitations of the current approach in extracting symbolic representations, we can appreciate the recent development of $\beta$-VAE, a variant of the variational autoencoder used to learn disentangled representations. Finally, we can conclude by mentioning less technical matters, such as libraries and hardware used.

\section{Loss functions}

The idea of image reconstruction plays a vital role throughout this project. Although it's possible to qualitatively compare the original to its reconstruction, it's important to be able to quantify the difference, which lends itself to automation. The loss function will quantify how similar two images are.

To compare loss functions, we'll use the MNIST data set. MNIST is a collection of $70,000$ black-and-white images of handwritten digits, with $60,000$ in the training set containing and $10,000$ in the test set. These images will be represented as vectors without loss of generality.

\subsection{Euclidean Distance}

The Euclidean distance between two vectors $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ is defined by $$\sqrt{\sum_{i}(x_i - y_i)^2}$$ where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the $i^{th}$ components of $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ respectively.

Euclidean distance is an intuitive measure of the distance between two points in space. Unfortunately, this doesn't also translate to visual similarity, as illustrated by Doersch et al. \cite{Doersch2016}. Figure \ref{fig:eucledian_distance_a} is a digit drawn from the MNIST dataset, and Figures \ref{fig:eucledian_distance_b} and \ref{fig:eucledian_distance_c} are attempted reconstructions. Of the reconstructions, Figure \ref{fig:eucledian_distance_c} looks most like the original, but Figure \ref{fig:eucledian_distance_b} is closer in space.\\

\end{figure}

This leads to an alternative measure, binary cross-entropy, which gives a much better quantification of how visually similar two images are.

\subsection{Binary Cross-Entropy}
Consider a single black-and-white pixel with probability $p(0) = c$ of being $0$ and $p(1) = 1 - c$ of being $1$. Here $p(x)$ is a probability distribution over the possible pixel values $x \in \{0, 1\}$. Suppose a given model tries to learn the distribution described by $p(x)$, and says that the pixel has probability $q(0) = \hat{c}$ of being $0$ and $q(1) = 1 - \hat{c}$ of being $1$. The model is perfect if it learns the true distribution, that is, if $q(x) = p(x)$ for $x\in\{0,1\}$. We'd like to quantify how similar the distributions $p$ and $q$ are.

This is done by computing the binary cross-entropy between $p$ and $q$, which is defined by $$H(p,q) = -c\log\hat{c} - (1-c)\log(1-\hat{c})$$ To see how we may use this as a similarity measure among images, consider a $1\times1$ image. Normalising this image yields a pixel value in the interval $[0, 1]$, which may now be interpreted as a probability, corresponding to $c$ above. In the normalised reconstructed image, the pixel value corresponds to $\hat{c}$. We simply compute the binary cross-entropy to measure the similarity of these two distributions, and in turn, the similarity of the images themselves! (Note: we could have also assigned the probabilities to $1-y$ and $1-\hat{y}$ by symmetry of binary cross-entropy).

For images larger than $1 \times 1$, we may take the component-wise binary cross-entropy, then, for example, average the components. How the component-wise binary cross-entropies are combined to give a score single floating point number is the choice of the designer and will vary from problem to problem.

\section{Autoencoders}

An autoencoder is a neural network that learns a compression algorithm for its input data in an unsupervised manner \cite{Liou2008}. This is achieved by placing constraints on a hidden layer, called the latent space, and setting the target values to the input values, effectively learning the identity function. Since the network is trying to reconstruct the original input from the constrained latent space, over time the latent space corresponds to a meaningful compression of the network's input.

\caption{A black-box description of an autoencoder. The autoencoder learns the identity function, and in turn, the encoder and decoder learn suitable encoding and decoding algorithms respectively.}
\label{fig:autoencoder_black_box_architecture}
\end{figure}

As before, we will use the MNIST data set to compare architectures. Unless specified in the example, the Adam optimiser is used with a learning rate of $1e-4$, the batch size is 1 and the loss function is binary cross-entropy. Intermediate layers use the ReLU activation function, while the final layer uses sigmoid.

\subsection{Fully-Connected Autoencoders}

In dense feed-forward neural networks we may place a constraint on the latent space by reducing the number of neurons, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:autoencoder_architecture}. Images must be flattened into vectors to be fed as input. Consequently, any spatial information is destroyed in dense feed-forward neural networks.

\caption{An example architecture of a fully-connected autoencoder. The latent space is constrained by having fewer neurons than the input and output layers.}
\label{fig:autoencoder_architecture}
\end{figure}

An example architecture is given in Table \ref{tab:fully_connected_autoencoder_architecture}, which was trained on MNIST. Despite the latent space being $\sim4\%$ of the size of the input space, the network is capable of producing realistic reconstructions. For verification, a collection of samples from the dataset and their corresponding reconstructions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:fully_connected_autoencoder_mnist}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Fully-Convolutional Autoencoders}

In fully-convolutional feed-forward neural networks, we may place a constraint on the latent space by reducing the number and/or size of the filters, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:convolutional_autoencoder_architecture}. To compare the fully-convolutional autoencoder to the fully-connected, we'll train the architecture in Table \ref{tab:convolutional_autoencoder_architecture} on MNIST. As before, we'll compare the reconstructions to the originals, which can be found in Figure \ref{fig:convolutional_autoencoder_mnist}.

\end{figure}

Convolutional layers have been shown to be effective in tasks with images as input \cite{Krizhevsky2012, Zeiler2014, Szegedy2015}. This is because spatial information is preserved in convolutional layers, and the number of trainable parameters is far less in a convolutional layer than it is in a fully connected layer. Convolutional layers will be used from here on as we'll be using images as input.

\subsection{Variational Autoencoders}

The variational autoencoder is central to this project, and we'll therefore dedicate a considerable amount of time exploring it. First we'll relate the variational autoencoder to ones seen earlier. This will lead us to formalise the proposed approach, after which we can develop an intuition about its implementation by way of concrete examples.

\subsubsection{Introduction}
So far we've seen autoencoders that take an input $\vec{x}$ and output a reconstruction $\vec{\tilde{x}}$, after mapping the input to a lower-dimensional representation $\vec{z}$. Putting our probabilistic hat on gives an entirely new and exciting idea: each of the inputs $\vec{x}$ are actually samples from an unknown probability distribution $p(\vec{x})$ \cite{Doersch2016}. The variational autoencoder's aim is to learn $p(\vec{x})$ in an unsupervised manner, and consequently be able to generate new samples never seen in the original data set.

Let's formalise this probabilistic perspective, then see how we may implement such a model.

\subsubsection{Probabilistic Perspective}
Let $X = \{\vec{x}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{N}$ be the data set of $N$ independent and identically distributed samples of the variable $\vec{x}$. Let us assume that these samples are generated by a random process with parameters $\vec{\theta^*}$ involving an unobserved latent variable $\vec{z}$ in the following way:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A latent variable $\vec{z}^{(i)}$ is drawn from the prior: $\vec{z}^{(i)} \sim p_{\vec{\theta^*}}(\vec{z})$
\item A new data point $\vec{x}^{(i)}$ is drawn from a conditional distribution: $\vec{x}^{(i)} \sim p_{\vec{\theta^*}}(\vec{x}|\vec{z})$
\end{enumerate}

Let us also assume that the prior $p_{\vec{\theta^*}}(\vec{z})$ and likelihood $p_{\vec{\theta^*}}(\vec{x}|\vec{z})$ are parameterised by the distributions $p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z})$ and $p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}|\vec{z})$ respectively. The true parameters $\vec{\theta}^*$ and latent variables $\vec{z}^{(i)}$ that produced $X$ are completely unknown to us; we only observe the samples in $X$.

We'd like to be able to infer the latent variable of a given data point, or more precisely, we'd like to be able to calculate the posterior $p(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$. By Bayes' theorem, the posterior is given by
\[
p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x}) = \frac{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}|\vec{z})p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z})}{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x})}
\]
However, due to the marginal likelihood
\[
p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}) = \int p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z})p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}|\vec{z})d\vec{z}
\]
being intractable, we may not calculate $p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$ analytically. Instead, we define an approximation $q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$ to the intractable posterior $p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$. We will come to see how the variational autoencoder will jointly learn the parameters $\vec{\phi}$ and $\vec{\theta}$. With these alone, we are able to encode a given sample with $q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$, called the probabilistic encoder, and decode a given latent variable with $p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}|\vec{z})$, called the probabilistic decoder.
