\section{Introduction}

We will cover how deep symbolic reinforcement learning extracts symbolic representations from raw input data, which will motivate a discussion of loss functions and the introduction of autoencoders. Seeing the limitations of the current approach in extracting symbolic representations, we can appreciate the recent development of $\beta$-VAE, a variant of the variational autoencoder used to learn disentangled representations. Finally, we can conclude by mentioning less technical matters, such as libraries and hardware used.

\section{Loss functions}

The idea of image reconstruction plays a vital role throughout this project. Although it's possible to qualitatively compare the original to its reconstruction, it's important to be able to quantify the difference, which lends itself to automation. The loss function will quantify how similar two images are.

To compare loss functions, we'll use the MNIST data set. MNIST is a collection of $70,000$ black-and-white images of handwritten digits, with $60,000$ in the training set containing and $10,000$ in the test set. These images will be represented as vectors without loss of generality.

\subsection{Euclidean Distance}

The Euclidean distance between two vectors $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ is defined by $$\sqrt{\sum_{i}(x_i - y_i)^2}$$ where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the $i^{th}$ components of $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ respectively.

Euclidean distance is an intuitive measure of the distance between two points in space. Unfortunately, this doesn't also translate to visual similarity, as illustrated by Doersch et al. \cite{Doersch2016}. Figure \ref{fig:eucledian_distance_a} is a digit drawn from the MNIST dataset, and Figures \ref{fig:eucledian_distance_b} and \ref{fig:eucledian_distance_c} are attempted reconstructions. Of the reconstructions, Figure \ref{fig:eucledian_distance_c} looks most like the original, but Figure \ref{fig:eucledian_distance_b} is closer in space.\\

\end{figure}

This leads to an alternative measure, binary cross-entropy, which gives a much better quantification of how visually similar two images are.

\subsection{Binary Cross-Entropy}
Consider a single black-and-white pixel with probability $p(0) = c$ of being $0$ and $p(1) = 1 - c$ of being $1$. Here $p(x)$ is a probability distribution over the possible pixel values $x \in \{0, 1\}$. Suppose a given model tries to learn the distribution described by $p(x)$, and says that the pixel has probability $q(0) = \hat{c}$ of being $0$ and $q(1) = 1 - \hat{c}$ of being $1$. The model is perfect if it learns the true distribution, that is, if $q(x) = p(x)$ for $x\in\{0,1\}$. We'd like to quantify how similar the distributions $p$ and $q$ are.

This is done by computing the binary cross-entropy between $p$ and $q$, which is defined by $$H(p,q) = -c\log\hat{c} - (1-c)\log(1-\hat{c})$$ To see how we may use this as a similarity measure among images, consider a $1\times1$ image. Normalising this image yields a pixel value in the interval $[0, 1]$, which may now be interpreted as a probability, corresponding to $c$ above. In the normalised reconstructed image, the pixel value corresponds to $\hat{c}$. We simply compute the binary cross-entropy to measure the similarity of these two distributions, and in turn, the similarity of the images themselves! (Note: we could have also assigned the probabilities to $1-y$ and $1-\hat{y}$ by symmetry of binary cross-entropy).

For images larger than $1 \times 1$, we may take the component-wise binary cross-entropy, then, for example, average the components. How the component-wise binary cross-entropies are suitably combined to give a single floating point number will vary from problem to problem.

\section{Autoencoders}

An autoencoder is a neural network that learns a compression algorithm for its input data in an unsupervised manner \cite{Liou2008}. This is achieved by placing constraints on a hidden layer, called the latent space, and setting the target values to the input values, effectively learning the identity function. Since the network is trying to reconstruct the original input from the constrained latent space, over time the latent space corresponds to a meaningful compression of the network's input.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{A black-box description of an autoencoder. The autoencoder learns the identity function, and in turn, the encoder and decoder learn suitable encoding and decoding algorithms respectively.}
\label{fig:autoencoder_black_box_architecture}
\end{figure}

As before, we will use the MNIST data set to compare architectures. Unless specified in the example, the Adam optimiser is used with a learning rate of $1e-4$, the batch size is 1 and the loss function is binary cross-entropy. Intermediate layers use the ReLU activation function, while the final layer uses sigmoid.

\subsection{Fully-Connected Autoencoders}

In dense feed-forward neural networks we may place a constraint on the latent space by reducing the number of neurons, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:autoencoder_architecture}. Images must be flattened into vectors to be fed as input. Consequently, any spatial information is destroyed in dense feed-forward neural networks.

\caption{An example architecture of a fully-connected autoencoder. The latent space is constrained by having fewer neurons than the input and output layers.}
\label{fig:autoencoder_architecture}
\end{figure}

An example architecture is given in Table \ref{tab:fully_connected_autoencoder_architecture}, which was trained on MNIST. Despite the latent space being $\sim4\%$ of the size of the input space, the network is capable of producing realistic reconstructions. For verification, a collection of samples from the dataset and their corresponding reconstructions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:fully_connected_autoencoder_mnist}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Fully-Convolutional Autoencoders}

In fully-convolutional feed-forward neural networks, we may place a constraint on the latent space by reducing the number and/or size of the filters, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:convolutional_autoencoder_architecture}. To compare the fully-convolutional autoencoder to the fully-connected, we'll train the architecture in Table \ref{tab:convolutional_autoencoder_architecture} on MNIST. As before, we'll compare the reconstructions to the originals, which can be found in Figure \ref{fig:convolutional_autoencoder_mnist}.

\end{figure}

Convolutional layers have been shown to be effective in tasks with images as input \cite{Krizhevsky2012, Zeiler2014, Szegedy2015}. This is because spatial information is preserved in convolutional layers, and the number of trainable parameters is far less in a convolutional layer than it is in a fully connected layer. Convolutional layers will be used from here on as we'll be using images as input.

\subsection{Variational Autoencoders}

The variational autoencoder is central to this project, and we'll therefore dedicate a considerable amount of time exploring it. First we'll precisely define the problems the variational autoencoder solves, after which we may develop its loss function and detail its implementation. This section will conclude by developing an intution of the theory covered by way of examples.

\subsubsection{A Probabilistic Perspective}
We'll begin by making necessary definitions and describe the input data as samples from a generative process.. This sets the context to detail the problems the variational autoencoder solves.

Let $X = \{\vec{x}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{N}$ be the data set of $N$ independent and identically distributed samples of the variable $\vec{x}$. ($X$ may be a data set of images, for instance). Let us assume that these samples are generated by a random process with parameters $\vec{\theta^*}$ involving an unobserved latent variable $\vec{z}$ in the following way:\\

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Generate data set $X$}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \For{$i = 1 \to N$}
      \State $\vec{z}^{(i)} \sim p_{\vec{\theta}^*}(\vec{z})$ \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad // Sample from true prior
      \State $\vec{x}^{(i)} \sim p_{\vec{\theta}^*}(\vec{x} | \vec{z}^{(i)})$ \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\enspace\enspace\thinspace // Sample from true conditional
      \State Append $\vec{x}^{(i)}$ to $X$
  \EndFor
  \end{algorithmic}
  \label{alg:generate_data_set_x}
\end{algorithm}

We only observe the data set $X$ in this process. The parameters $\vec{\theta}^*$ and latent variables $Z = \{ \vec{z}^{(i)} \}_{i=1}^{N}$ are unknown to us. Let us assume that the prior $p_{\vec{\theta^*}}(\vec{z})$ and conditional $p_{\vec{\theta^*}}(\vec{x}|\vec{z})$ are parameterised by the distributions $p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z})$ and $p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}|\vec{z})$ respectively. In this context, the variational autoencoder provides \cite{Kingma2014}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item ML or MAP estimation for the parameters $\vec{\theta}$
\item An approximation of the latent variable $\vec{z}^{(i)}$ given $\vec{x}^{(i)}$ and set of parameters $\vec{\theta}$
\item Approximate marginal inference of the variable $\vec{x}$
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Overcoming the Intractable Posterior}
The variational autoencoder solves the problems above by approximate inference of the latent variable $\vec{z}$. Exact inference is not possible, and to see this we may use Bayes' theorem to find an expression for the posterior:
\begin{align}
p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x}) = \frac{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}|\vec{z})p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z})}{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x})}
\end{align}
The marginal likelihood
\begin{align}
p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}) = \int p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z})p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}|\vec{z})d\vec{z}
\end{align}
involves an exponential-time integral over every combination of the latent variable $\vec{z}$, and is therefore computationally intractable \cite{Kingma2014}. Instead, we define an approximation $q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$ to the intractable posterior. Since $q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$ gives a distribution over the possible latent variables $\vec{z}$ that generated the given data point $\vec{x}$, it is known as the probabilistic decoder. By the same reasoning, $p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}|\vec{z})$ is known as the probabilistic decoder.

\subsubsection{Finding a Suitable Loss Function: the ELBO}
The variational autoencoers's ability to learn the generative parameters $\vec{\theta}^*$ relies on how closley $q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$ approximates $p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$. In the interest of training a model, this difference will be quantified. For this we use the KL divergence
\begin{align}
D_{KL}(q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})||p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})) = \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\bigg[\log_{e}\frac{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\bigg]
\end{align}
which measures how much information is lost when we represent $p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$ with $q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$ (measured in nats) \cite{Burnham2002}. Using the KL divergence, our problem now amounts to the optimisation problem \cite{Li2016}:
\begin{align}
\vec{\theta}^*, \vec{\phi}^* = \arg\min_{\vec{\theta}^*, \vec{\phi}^*} D_{KL}(q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})||p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x}))
\label{eq:kl_divergence_optimisation_problem}
\end{align}
To see how we can start to minimise the KL divergence, we'll start by rewriting it in a different form:
\begin{align}
D_{KL}(q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})||p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})) &= \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\bigg[\log_{e}\frac{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\bigg] \\
&= \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\big[\log_{e}q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})\big] - \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\big[{\log_ep_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\big] \\
&= \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\big[\log_{e}q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})\big] - \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\bigg[\log_e\frac{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z},\vec{x})}{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x})}\bigg] \\
&= \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\bigg[\log_{e}\frac{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}{{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z},\vec{x})}}\bigg] + \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}[\log_ep_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x})] \\
&= \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\bigg[\log_{e}\frac{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}{{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z},\vec{x})}}\bigg] + \log_ep_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x})
\label{eq:kl_divergence}
\end{align}
Here we see that the KL divergence depends on the intractable marginal likelihood $p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x})$! There's no way we can minimise it if we can't write down $p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x})$. However, we can get around this: we'll minimise the KL divergence, but not directly. Instead, we try to find a quantity which we can maximise, and show that in turn this minimises the KL divergence. The trick is not obvious, but is simply done by finding a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood.

Using Jensen's inequality
\begin{align}
f(\mathbf{E}\big[X\big]) \geq \mathbf{E}\big[ f(X) \big]
\end{align}
we can write down a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood:
\begin{align}
\log_ep_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}) &= \log_e\int p_{\vec{\vec{\theta}}}(\vec{x}, \vec{z})d\vec{z} \\
&= \log_e\int p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}, \vec{z}) \frac{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})} d\vec{z} \\
&= \log_e\mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\bigg[  \frac{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}, \vec{z})}{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})} \bigg] \\
&\geq \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\bigg[  \log_e\frac{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}, \vec{z})}{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})} \bigg] \label{eq:elbo}\\
&:= \mathcal{L}(\vec{\theta}, \vec{\phi}; \vec{x})
\end{align}
Expression (\ref{eq:elbo}) is called the $ELBO$ (short for expected lower bound) \cite{Blei2011, Kingma2014}.

How does the $ELBO$ help us with minimising the KL divergence? First recall the alternative form of the KL divergence written in Equation (\ref{eq:kl_divergence}):
\[
D_{KL}(q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})||p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})) = \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\bigg[\log_{e}\frac{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}{{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z},\vec{x})}}\bigg] + \log_ep_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x})
\]
Writing this in terms of the $ELBO$ we have:
\begin{align}
D_{KL}(q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})||p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})) = -\mathcal{L}(\vec{\theta}, \vec{\phi}; \vec{x}) + \log_ep_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x})
\end{align}
Since the KL divergence is the negative of the $ELBO$ up to an additive constant (with respect to $q$), minimising the KL divergence is equivalent to maximising the $ELBO$ \cite{Blei2016}. Now we may make a revision to our original optimisaiton problem (\ref{eq:kl_divergence_optimisation_problem}). Our problem is written as \cite{Li2016}:
\begin{align}
\vec{\theta}^*, \vec{\phi}^* = \arg\max_{\vec{\theta}^*, \vec{\phi}^*} \mathcal{L}(\vec{\theta}, \vec{\phi}; \vec{x})
\label{eq:elbo_optimisation_problem}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Writing the ELBO in Closed-Form}
We've found that we can maximise the $ELBO$ to minimise the KL divergence between the approximation $q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$ and the intractable posterior $p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$. Now we will seek to write the $ELBO$ in closed-form, after which we will be able to implement the variational autoencoder.

To write the $ELBO$ in closed-form, we'll start with a useful manipulation:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}(\vec{\theta}, \vec{\phi}; \vec{x}) &= \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\bigg[  \log_e\frac{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}, \vec{z})}{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})} \bigg] \\
&= -\mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\bigg[ \log_e\frac{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}, \vec{z})} \bigg] \\
&= -\mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\bigg[ \log_e\frac{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x} | \vec{z}) p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z})} \bigg] \\
&= -\mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\bigg[ \log_e\frac{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}{p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z})} \bigg] +  \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\big[\log_e p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x} | \vec{z}) \big]\\
&= -D_{KL}(q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x}) || p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z})) + \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})}\big[\log p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x} | \vec{z}) \big]
\label{eq:elbo_reconstruction_kl_divergence}
\end{align}

Thus for a single data point $\vec{x}^{(i)}$, the $ELBO$ becomes:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\vec{\theta}, \vec{\phi}; \vec{x}^{(i)}) = -D_{KL}(q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x}^{(i)}) || p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z})) + \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x}^{(i)})}\big[\log p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}^{(i)} | \vec{z}) \big]
\end{equation}

With some assumptions and a bit of work, we're finally in a position to write the $ELBO$ in closed-form. The first term is the KL divergence between the probabilistic encoder and the prior. To make our lives simpler, we can choose the prior to be the isotropic multivariate Gaussian:
\begin{align}
p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z}) = \mathcal{N}(\vec{0}, \vec{I})
\end{align}
We will also assume that the posterior is a $k$-dimensional Gaussian with diagonal covariance. It follows that the approximate posterior should take the same form. That is,
\begin{align}
q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z} | \vec{x}^{(i)}) = \mathcal{N}(\vec{\mu}^{(i)}, \vec{\sigma}^{2(i)}\vec{I})
\label{eq:approximate_posterior_gaussian}
\end{align}
where $\vec{\mu}^{(i)}$ and $\vec{\sigma}^{(i)}$ are the mean and standard deviation (respectively) for data point $\vec{x}^{(i)}$. With these two assumptions, and the KL divergence for $k$-dimensional Gaussians,
\begin{align}
D_{KL}(\mathcal{N}_0 || \mathcal{N}_1) = \frac{1}{2}\bigg[\Tr(\vec{\Sigma_1}^{-1}\vec{\Sigma_0}) + (\vec{\mu}_1 - \vec{\mu}_0)^T\vec{\Sigma_1}^{-1}(\vec{\mu}_1-\vec{\mu}_0) - k + \ln\bigg(\frac{\det\vec{\Sigma_1}}{\det\vec{\Sigma_0}}\bigg) \bigg]
\end{align}
we may write the first term in closed-form:
\begin{align}
D_{KL}(q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x}^{(i)}) || p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{z})) &= \frac{1}{2}\bigg[ \sum_{j=1}^k \sigma^{2(i)}_j + \sum_{j=1}^k\mu^{2(i)}_j - k - \ln\prod_{j=1}^k\sigma^{2(i)}_j \bigg]
\end{align}
Now we turn our attention to the second term of the $ELBO$:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x}^{(i)})}\big[\log p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}^{(i)} | \vec{z}) \big]
\end{align}
Luckily, maximising terms like this is encountered regularly in statistics, and is known as maximum likelihood estimation. This can be taken to be the reconstruction loss (defined it earlier) \cite{Li2016}.

Therefore, using an unspecified reconstruction loss, the $ELBO$ is:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}(\vec{\theta}, \vec{\phi}; \vec{x}) = \frac{1}{2}\bigg[ \sum_{j=1}^k \sigma^{2(i)}_j + \sum_{j=1}^k\mu^{2(i)}_j - k - \ln\prod_{j=1}^k\sigma^{2(i)}_j \bigg] + \mathbf{E}_{q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x}^{(i)})}\big[\log p_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}^{(i)} | \vec{z}) \big]
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Implementing the Variational Autoencoder}

The variational autoencoder uses a neural network for the probabilistic encoder $q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$ \cite{Kingma2014}. First a na\"{i}ve implementation of the variational autoencoder will be proposed. As we shall see, this implementation needs one adjustment, known as the ``reparameterisatoin trick". This will lead to the final implementation of the variational autoencoder, and conclude our formal study.

The probabilistic encoder (\ref{eq:approximate_posterior_gaussian})
\[
q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z} | \vec{x}^{(i)}) = \mathcal{N}(\vec{\mu}^{(i)}, \vec{\sigma}^{2(i)}\vec{I})
\]
requires the mean $\vec{\mu}^{(i)}$ and standard deviation $\vec{\sigma}^{(i)}$ for a given data point $\vec{x}^{(i)}$. These two vectors will be represented by distinct layers in the latent space of a neural network, as shown in Figure (\ref{fig:variational_autoencoder_naive}) \cite{Li2016}.\\

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\captionsetup{justification=centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{background/variational_autoencoder_naive.eps}
\caption{A na\"{i}ve implementation of the variational autoencoder. The input $\vec{x}$ is mapped to intermediate layers taking the values of $\vec{\mu}$ and $\vec{\sigma}^2$. The latent variable $\vec{z}$ is then sampled from the probabilistic encoder $\vec{z} \sim q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z} | \vec{x})$. Finally $\vec{z}$ is mapped back to the input dimension to give reconstruction $\vec{\tilde{x}}$.}
\label{fig:variational_autoencoder_naive}
\end{figure}

Unfortuntely we cannot perform backpropagation, as it makes no sense to differentiate the the random variable $\vec{z}$ wrt $\vec{\phi}$ ($\vec{z}$ is drawn from a distribution, and not a function of $\vec{\phi}$). To solve this, we introduce an auxillary variable $\vec{\epsilon}$ and vector-valued function $g_{\phi}(\vec{x}, \vec{\epsilon})$ parameterised by $\vec{\phi}$ \cite{Kingma2014}. The auxillary variable $\vec{\epsilon}$ is governed by a parameterless distribution, which we will take to be the multivariate isotropic Gaussian.

The sampling step can now be written as
\begin{align}
\vec{z} = g_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{x}, \vec{\epsilon}) = \vec{\mu} + \vec{\sigma} \odot \vec{\epsilon} \quad\quad\quad \vec{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(\vec{0}, \vec{I})
\end{align}
where $\odot$ represents the element-wise product. This is a reparameterisation of the random variable $\vec{z}\sim q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z}|\vec{x})$ with a differentiable function $g_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{x}, \vec{\epsilon})$, and is suitable known as the ``reparameterisation trick" \cite{Kingma2014}. The reparameterisation trick allows backpropagation to be used, and thus completes our method of solving optimisation problem (\ref{eq:elbo_optimisation_problem}).\\

\caption{A viable implementation of the variational autoencoder. Sampling from the probabilistic encoder $q_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{z} | \vec{x})$ is simulated by evaluating $\vec{z} = g_{\vec{\phi}}(\vec{x}, \vec{\epsilon}) = \vec{\mu} + \vec{\sigma} \odot \vec{\epsilon}$.}
