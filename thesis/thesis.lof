\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.6}{\ignorespaces A na\"{i}ve implementation of the variational autoencoder. The input $\bm {x}$ is mapped to intermediate layers taking the values of $\bm {\mu }$ and $\bm {\sigma }^2$. The latent variable $\bm {z}$ is then sampled from the probabilistic encoder $\bm {z} \sim q_{\bm {\phi }}(\bm {z} | \bm {x})$.
