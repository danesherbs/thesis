\section{Motivation and Objectives}

A long term goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). 	A number of theoretical frameworks have been presented as formalizations of what it means to achieve AGI, notably by Hutter \cite{Hutter2005}.

Reinforcement learning is fundemental in this framework. Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning systems have mastered a wide range of tasks, including Atari 2600 games and Go \cite{Mnih2015}.
